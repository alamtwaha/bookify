        <p class="text">
          I'm driving home for Christmas <br>
          Oh, I can't wait to see those faces<br>
          I'm driving home for Christmas, yea<br>
          Well I'm moving down that line<br>
          And it's been so long<br>
          But I will be there<br>
          I sing this song<br>
          To pass the time away<br>
          Driving in my car<br>
          Driving home for Christmas<br>
          It's gonna take some time<br>
          But I'll get there<br>
          Top to toe in tailbacks<br>
          Oh, I got red lights on the run<br>
          But soon there'll be a freeway yeah<br>
          Get my feet on holy ground<br>
          So I sing for you<br>
          Though you can't hear me<br>
          When I get trough<br>
          And feel you near me<br>
          Driving in my car<br>
          I'm driving home for Christmas<br>
          Driving home for Christmas<br>
          With a thousand memories<br>
          I take look at the driver next to me<br>
          He's just the same<br>
          Just the same<br>
          Top to toe in tailbacks<br>
          Oh, I got red lights all around<br>
          I'm driving home for Christmas, yea<br>
          Get my feet on holy ground<br>
          So I sing for you<br>
          Though you can't hear me<br>
          When I get trough<br>
          Oh and feel you near me<br>
          Driving in my car<br>
          Driving home for Christmas<br>
          Driving home for Christmas<br>
          With a thousand memories<br>
          I take look at the driver next to me<br>
          He's just the same<br>
          He's driving home, driving home<br>
          Driving home for Christmas<br>
          Driving home for Christmas<br>

            Christmas Is You</a> </h2>
        <h4> ~ click the title to listen ~ </h4>
        <p class="text">
          I don't want a lot for Christmas <br>
          There is just one thing I need<br>
          I don't care about the presents<br>
          Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
          I just want you for my own<br>
          More than you could ever know<br>
          Make my wish come true oh<br>
          All I want for Christmas is you<br>
          I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
          There is just one thing I need, and I<br>
          Don't care about the presents<br>
          Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
          I don't need to hang my stocking<br>
          There upon the fireplace<br>
          Santa Claus won't make me happy<br>
          With a toy on Christmas day<br>
          I just want you for my own<br>
          More than you could ever know<br>
          Make my wish come true<br>
          All I want for Christmas is you<br>
          I won't ask for much this Christmas<br>
          I won't even wish for snow, and I<br>
          I just wanna keep on waiting<br>
          Underneath the mistletoe<br>
          I won't make a list and send it<br>
          To the North Pole for Saint Nick<br>
          I won't even stay awake<br>
          To hear those magic reindeer click<br>
          'Cause I just want you here tonight<br>
          Holding on to me so tight<br>
          What more can I do<br>
          Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you<br>
          All the lights are shining<br>
          So brightly everywhere<br>
          And the sound of children's<br>
          Laughter fills the air<br>
          And everyone is singing<br>
          I hear those sleigh bells ringing<br>
          Santa won't you bring me<br>
          The one I really need<br>
          Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly<br>
          I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
          This is all I'm asking for<br>
          I just wanna see my baby<br>
          Standing right outside my door<br>
          I just want you for my own<br>
          More than you could ever know<br>
          Make my wish come true<br>
          Baby all I want for Christmas is you<br>
          All I want for Christmas is you, baby<br>
