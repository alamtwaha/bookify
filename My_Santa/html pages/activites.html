        <h1>Fun Christmas Activities for Kids and Families</h1>
        <p>With the holidays just around the corner, you may be starting to plan your big family Christmas party. But
          while you're busy cooking up the perfect Christmas dinner, you'll want to keep your loved ones
          occupied—especially if you plan on inviting little ones. Luckily for you, there are plenty of fun Christmas
          games for kids that'll keep them busy for hours—and may just interest you too (in between glazing the ham and
          decorating your gingerbread cookies, of course!). Sure, your appetizer spread alone might be enough to keep
          all
          of your guests entertained, but you'll soon find that the following Christmas games can bring your family
          together too. Some activity tips: </p>

        <h3>Christmas Cookies</h3>
        <img class="image" src="../img/cookie.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="">
        <p>Do you have a cookie monster in your house? Most kids love to eat cookies, but you may be surprised by how
          much
          little ones like to make cookies, too! Peanut-butter blossoms! Spritz cookies! Gingerbread men! There are just
          too many tasty holiday cookies to choose from.</p>

        <h3>Sledging & Snow Fun</h3>
        <img src="../img/sledge.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="">
        <p>For the children, snow always equals fun and as well as the all-important winter activities there will be
          plenty of time for you to play in the snow as a family and enjoy this wonderfully memorable experience
          together.

        <h3>Go for a Christmas light walk</h3>
        <img src="../img/lights.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="">
        <p>This is best in a residential area where children can look out for all the Christmas lights and other
          decorations. Look the variety of lights, indoors and out.
