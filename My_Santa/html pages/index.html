          <p><span><b>*</b> <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/05YyJ_cXVk8" target="_blank">Jingle Bells</a> was
              written
              for Thanksgiving, not Christmas. </span> The song was written in 1857 by James Lord Pierpont and published
            under the title “One Horse Open Sleigh”. It was supposed to be played in the composer’s Sunday school class
            during Thanksgiving as a way to commemorate the famed Medford sleigh races. “Jingle Bells” was also the
            first song to be broadcast from space. *</p>

          <p><b>*</b> The tradition of hanging stockings comes from a Dutch legend. A poor man had three daughters for
            whom he could not afford to provide a dowry. St. Nicholas dropped a bag of gold down his chimney and gold
            coins fell out and into the stockings drying by the fireplace. The daughters now had dowries and could be
            married, avoiding a life on the streets. *</p>

          <p><b>*</b> Brenda Lee recorded <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/is4NQkUN3AI" target="_blank">Rockin’
              Around the Christmas Tree </a> when she was only 13 years old. *</p>

          <p><b>*</b> You would have to use your artificial tree for more than 20 years for it to be ‘greener’ than
            buying a fresh-cut tree annually. *</p>

          <p><b>*</b> Coca-Cola was the first company that used <span class="santa">Santa Claus</span> during the winter
            season for promotion. * </p>
